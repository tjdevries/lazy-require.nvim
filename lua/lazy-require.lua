---@brief [[
--- Lazy.nvim is a set of helper functions to make requiring modules easier.
---
--- Feel free to just copy and paste these functions out or just add as a
--- dependency for your plugin / configuration.
---
--- Hope you enjoy (and if you have other kinds of lazy loading you'd like to see,
--- feel free to submit some issues. Metatables can do many fun things).

--- Require on index.
---
--- Will only require the module after the first index of a module.
--- Only works for modules that export a table.
lazy.require_on_index = function(require_path)
  return setmetatable({}, {
    __index = function(_, key)
      return require(require_path)[key]
    end,

    __newindex = function(_, key, value)
      require(require_path)[key] = value
    end,
  })
end

--- Requires only when you call the _module_ itself.
---
--- If you want to require an exported value from the module,
--- see instead |lazy.require_on_exported_call()|

  return setmetatable({}, {
    __call = function(_, ...)
      return require(require_path)(...)

end

--- Require when an exported method is called.
---
--- Creates a new function. Cannot be used to compare functions,
--- set new values, etc. Only useful for waiting to do the require until you actually
--- call the code.
